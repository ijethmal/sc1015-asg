## Student Alcohol Consumption Data Analysis
[MAIN.ipynb](https://github.com/ijethmal/sc1015-asg/blob/main/MAIN.ipynb) - SC1015 final assigment using data from students about their alcohol consumption habits, to figure out which factors of students' lives are the best predictors of high alcohol consumption.
### Conclusion:
- travel time: as the travel time increases the percentage liklelihood of high alcohol consumption increases and this could be related to socio economic factors.
- absences: generally as the no. of absences increases the percentage likelihood of high alcohol consumption increases
- as the amount of free time increases the liklihood of high alc consumption increases
- when students go out more their percentage likelihood of high alcohol consumption increases
- if the student has no romantic relationships then the percentage likelihood of high alcohol consumption increases. There is not that great of a difference between studesnts that have a romantic relationships and students that don't
- gender: males are much more likely to have a high percentage likelihood of alcohol consumption.
- studytime: as the study time increases the percentage likelihood of high alcohol consumption decreases
- famsup: students with the lack of family sypport at home are more likely to have a higher percentage consumption of alcohol
- higher: students who are not considering higher education are more likely to have a higher alcohol consumption
- reason: students that have a higher alcohol consumption had other reasons for choosing their secondary school other than course, reputation or distance from home
- age: the older a student is, the higher the percentage likelihood of alcohol consumption is.

## Shortest Path Project
[LAB 8 FINAL.ipynb](https://github.com/ijethmal/sc1015-asg/blob/main/LAB%208%20FINAL.ipynb) - Imagine you are a GPS trying to find the shortest distance from the start to the destination. Using a graph to represent the transport network, each node is a junction and each edge is a road of a different length. Our task was to find the shortest path from the start node 'A' to the destination node
